## Introduction

As a developer board, HALMET arrives with no pre-installed software. You will need to install suitable software yourself. While this is not difficult, some prior experience with microcontroller boards such as Arduino or ESP32 Devkits is recommended.

Example firmware for HALMET is available at the [HALMET-example-firmware GitHub repository](https://github.com/hatlabs/HALMET-example-firmware).

Please note that support for software development issues are only provided through the [Hat Labs discussion forum](https://github.com/hatlabs/discussions/discussions).

Further instructions to come soon.
